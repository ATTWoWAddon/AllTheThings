-- Use this file to define certain Things which should always be forcibly 'Filled' in-game
-- (i.e. they bypass the duplicate filled-group checks by hash)

-- This can be useful for Items which commonly show up multiple times within a given minilist or popout and
-- have no risk of infintely recursing their fill logic

-- This DB is defined by Class Type and then its Key Value
