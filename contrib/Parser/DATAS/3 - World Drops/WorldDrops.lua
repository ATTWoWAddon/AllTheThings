Intent on settling the arid region of Durotar, Thrall's new Horde expanded its ranks, inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs, tauren, & trolls. Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes & the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to a reinvigorated Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind's king, Varian Wrynn, mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was marred by the manipulations & mind control of the Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman. As heroes investigated Onyxia's manipulations, ancient foes surfaced in lands throughout the world to menace Horde & Alliance alike.|r",

However, the Broken Isles came with their own perils to overcome, from Xavius, to God-King Skovald, to the nightborne, & to Tidemistress Athissa. Khadgar moved Dalaran to the shores of this land, the city serves as a central hub for the heroes. The death knights of Acherus also took their floating necropolis to the Isles. The heroes of Azeroth sought out legendary artifact weapons to wield in battle, but also found unexpected allies in the form of the Illidari. Ongoing conflict between the Alliance & the Horde led to the formation of the class orders, with exceptional commanders putting aside faction to lead their classes in the fight against the Legion.|r",
